# ESP Web Flasher

JavaScript package to install firmware on ESP devices via the browser using WebSerial.

## Origin

This project started as a fork of [Adafruit WebSerial ESPTool](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_WebSerial_ESPTool) written by
[Melissa LeBlanc-Williams](https://github.com/makermelissa) in June 2021. At the time fo the fork, the original repository was a single-use website. This fork converted the code into a reusable package and published it to NPM.

In March 2022 [Nabu Casa](https://www.nabucasa.com) took over maintenance from Adafruit and this fork became the main code base.
